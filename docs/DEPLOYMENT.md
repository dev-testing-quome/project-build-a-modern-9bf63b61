# Deployment Guide - project-build-a-modern

This guide outlines the deployment process for "project-build-a-modern," a modern e-commerce platform.  This guide assumes familiarity with command-line interfaces, Docker, and at least one cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure).  Adapt commands and configurations to your specific chosen provider.

## Prerequisites

**Required Software and Tools:**

* Docker: `https://www.docker.com/`
* Docker Compose: `https://docs.docker.com/compose/`
* Git: `https://git-scm.com/`
* A Cloud Provider account (AWS, GCP, Azure - choose one).
* Node.js and npm (or yarn):  The specific versions will be specified in the project's `package.json`.
* A text editor or IDE.

**System Requirements:**

* A machine with sufficient RAM (at least 4GB recommended, 8GB+ preferred for production).
* Sufficient disk space for the application, database, and logs.
* A stable internet connection.

**Account Setup:**

* **Cloud Provider:** Create an account with your chosen cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure).  You'll need appropriate billing information and potentially a suitable compute instance.
* **Stripe:** Create a Stripe account to enable payment processing. Obtain your publishable and secret API keys.
* **Email Service:** Set up an email service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) for order notifications.  Obtain necessary API keys.


## Environment Setup

**Environment Variables Configuration:**

Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory. This file should contain all environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database_name
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
APP_URL=http://your-app-url.com  # Replace with your app URL
NODE_ENV=development # Change to 'production' for production deployment
```

**Database Setup:**

1. **Choose a Database:** PostgreSQL is recommended.  You can use a cloud-managed database service or set up your own instance.
2. **Create the Database:** Create a database instance with appropriate credentials.
3. **Populate `.env`:** Update the `DATABASE_URL` variable in your `.env` file with the connection string.

**External Service Configuration:**

Configure your email service and Stripe API keys in the `.env` file as shown above.


## Docker Deployment

**Building the Docker Image:**

Navigate to the project's root directory and run:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

**Running with Docker Compose:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command builds and starts all containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file (assuming you have one).

**Environment Configuration:**

Docker Compose will automatically load environment variables from the `.env` file. Ensure this file is present and correctly configured.

**Health Checks and Monitoring:**

Implement health checks within your application and configure Docker Compose to monitor container health.  Example in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
```

## Production Deployment

**Cloud Deployment Options:**

* **AWS:** Use Elastic Beanstalk, ECS (Elastic Container Service), or EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).
* **GCP:** Use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Cloud Run, or App Engine.
* **Azure:** Use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure App Service, or Azure Container Instances.

**Container Orchestration:**

* **Kubernetes (recommended for scalability and resilience):**  Deploy your Docker image to your chosen Kubernetes cluster.  Use kubectl to manage deployments, services, and ingress.
* **Docker Swarm:**  A simpler option for smaller deployments.

**Load Balancing and Scaling:**

Use your cloud provider's load balancing service to distribute traffic across multiple instances of your application.  Scale horizontally by adding more containers/pods as needed.

**SSL/TLS Configuration:**

Obtain an SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt is a free option) and configure it with your load balancer or reverse proxy.


## Database Setup

**Database Migration Commands:**

Your project should include database migration tools (e.g., Sequelize migrations, Prisma migrations).  Use these tools to apply schema changes to your database.  Example (Sequelize):

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

**Initial Data Setup:**

Use seed files or scripts to populate your database with initial data (e.g., product categories, default users).

**Backup and Recovery Procedures:**

Implement regular database backups (e.g., using your cloud provider's snapshotting capabilities or pg_dump).  Establish a recovery procedure to restore your database from backups.


## Monitoring & Logging

**Application Monitoring Setup:**

Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic to monitor application performance, resource usage, and error rates.

**Log Aggregation:**

Use a centralized logging system like Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK stack) or a cloud-based logging service (e.g., CloudWatch, Cloud Logging, Azure Monitor).

**Performance Monitoring:**

Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response times, request rates, and error rates. Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks.

**Error Tracking:**

Use error tracking services like Sentry or Rollbar to capture and analyze application errors.


## Troubleshooting

**Common Deployment Issues:**

* **Connection errors:** Check database connection strings, API keys, and network connectivity.
* **Port conflicts:** Ensure that the ports used by your application are not already in use.
* **Missing dependencies:** Verify that all necessary packages and modules are installed.

**Debug Commands:**

* `docker logs <container_name>`: View logs for a specific container.
* `docker exec -it <container_name> bash`: Access a running container's shell for debugging.

**Log Locations:**

Log locations will vary depending on your application and logging configuration.  Check your application's logs and your logging system's configuration.

**Recovery Procedures:**

Have a plan for recovering from failures. This includes restoring from backups, restarting containers, and scaling up resources.


## Security Considerations

**Environment Variable Security:**

* **Never hardcode sensitive information in your code.**  Use environment variables exclusively.
* **Use a secrets management service** (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage sensitive data.

**Network Security:**

* **Use firewalls** to restrict access to your application and database.
* **Implement proper network segmentation.**
* **Regularly scan for vulnerabilities.**

**Authentication Setup:**

Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT) to protect user accounts.

**Regular Security Updates:**

Keep your application, dependencies, and operating system up-to-date with the latest security patches.


This guide provides a framework. You'll need to adapt it based on the specifics of your "project-build-a-modern" application and chosen technologies. Remember to thoroughly test your deployment process in a staging environment before deploying to production.
