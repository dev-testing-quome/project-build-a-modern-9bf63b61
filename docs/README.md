## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-build-a-modern
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Application:**

   * **Backend:** (from the `backend` directory)
     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```

   * **Frontend:** (from the `frontend` directory)
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```


### Docker Setup

1.  Navigate to the root of the project directory.
2.  Run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.  Access the application via the URLs specified in the "API Documentation" section.


## API Documentation

Once the application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:

* **API Documentation (Swagger UI):**  http://localhost:8000/docs
* **Alternative API Docs (ReDoc):** http://localhost:8000/redoc


## Usage

**Key Endpoints (Examples):**

* `/products`:  GET request to retrieve a list of products.  Can include query parameters for filtering and pagination.
* `/products/{product_id}`: GET request to retrieve a specific product by ID.
* `/cart`:  POST request to add a product to the cart; GET request to view the cart contents.
* `/checkout`: POST request to initiate the checkout process.


**Sample Request (GET /products):**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/products
```

**Sample Response (GET /products - JSON):**

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Product 1",
    "price": 19.99,
    "description": "..."
  },
  // ... more products
]
```

**Common Workflows:**  The application supports a standard e-commerce workflow: browsing products, adding items to the cart, proceeding to checkout, providing payment information (via Stripe's integration), and receiving order confirmation. The admin dashboard allows for managing products, viewing orders, and handling other administrative tasks.
