**Created**: October 26, 2023
**Last Updated**: October 26, 2023

## Summary

This RFC proposes a scalable and robust architecture for project-build-a-modern, a modern e-commerce platform.  The proposed architecture leverages a microservices approach with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and security.  Key technologies include React/TypeScript for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and Docker for containerization.  A phased implementation approach is outlined, prioritizing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) followed by iterative enhancements.

## Background and Motivation

The current lack of a modern e-commerce platform is hindering business growth and preventing us from effectively competing in the market.  Existing solutions are outdated, lack scalability, and are difficult to maintain.  This project aims to address these limitations by developing a new platform that is robust, scalable, and adaptable to future business needs.  The current limitations include:  inadequate search functionality, slow checkout process, limited payment options, poor mobile experience, and a lack of robust analytics.

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture

We propose a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and independent deployment of features.  Key microservices will include:

* **Catalog Service:** Manages product catalog, search, and filtering.
* **Cart Service:** Manages shopping carts and related operations.
* **Order Service:** Handles order placement, management, and tracking.
* **Payment Service:** Integrates with Stripe for payment processing.
* **Inventory Service:** Manages inventory levels and stock updates.
* **User Service:** Handles user authentication, authorization, and profile management.
* **Review Service:** Manages customer reviews and ratings.
* **Admin Service:** Provides an admin dashboard for managing products and orders.

These services will communicate via a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) and a RESTful API.  A dedicated API Gateway will handle routing and security.

### Technology Choices

* **Backend Framework:** FastAPI (Python) - chosen for its speed, ease of use, and automatic API documentation.
* **Frontend Framework:** React with TypeScript - chosen for its component-based architecture, large community support, and strong typing for improved maintainability.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL - chosen for its scalability, reliability, and robust features.  SQLAlchemy will be used for ORM.
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) - provides a secure and stateless authentication mechanism.
* **Search:** Elasticsearch - for powerful and scalable search capabilities.
* **Deployment:** Docker and Kubernetes - for containerization and orchestration, enabling seamless deployment and scaling.
* **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ - for asynchronous communication between microservices.
* **Caching:** Redis - for caching frequently accessed data.


### API Design

A RESTful API will be used, adhering to standard HTTP methods and conventions.  Endpoints will be versioned to allow for backward compatibility.  JSON will be the primary data format.  Detailed API specifications will be documented using OpenAPI.

### Database Schema

A relational database schema will be designed, reflecting the entity relationships between products, users, orders, and other entities.  Proper indexing will be implemented to optimize query performance.  Database migrations will be managed using Alembic.

### Security Considerations

* **Authentication and Authorization:** JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.
* **Data Encryption:** Encryption at rest and in transit using industry-standard algorithms.
* **Input Validation:** Robust input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implementation of rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
* **Security Audits:** Regular security audits and penetration testing.

### Performance Requirements

The system should be designed to handle a high volume of concurrent users and transactions.  Response times should be optimized, and caching strategies will be employed to improve performance.  Load testing will be conducted to ensure scalability.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - 4 weeks

* Core e-commerce functionality: product browsing, adding to cart, checkout with Stripe integration, user authentication, basic order management.
* Basic user interface and admin dashboard.
* Catalog, Cart, Order, User, and Payment services.

### Phase 2: Enhancement - 8 weeks

* Customer reviews and ratings, inventory management, advanced search and filtering, email notifications, improved UI/UX, responsive design.
* Implementation of remaining microservices (Review, Inventory, Admin).
* Performance optimization and security hardening.

### Phase 3: Production Readiness - 4 weeks

* Comprehensive testing, deployment automation (CI/CD pipeline), monitoring and logging, documentation.
* Load testing and performance tuning.

## Testing Strategy

* **Unit Testing:**  Each microservice will have comprehensive unit tests.
* **Integration Testing:**  Testing interactions between microservices.
* **End-to-End Testing:**  Testing the entire system flow.
* **Performance Testing:**  Load testing to ensure scalability and performance.

## Deployment and Operations

* Docker containers for each microservice.
* Kubernetes for orchestration and scalability.
* CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.
* Monitoring and alerting using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

## Alternative Approaches Considered

A monolithic architecture was considered but rejected due to scalability and maintainability concerns.  Other backend frameworks (Node.js, Go) were evaluated, but FastAPI was chosen for its ease of use and performance.

## Risks and Mitigation

* **Scalability issues:** Mitigation: Microservices architecture, horizontal scaling, caching.
* **Security vulnerabilities:** Mitigation: Regular security audits, penetration testing, secure coding practices.
* **Integration challenges:** Mitigation: Thorough testing, clear API specifications.
* **Development delays:** Mitigation: Agile development methodology, clear milestones.

## Success Metrics

* Number of registered users
* Average order value
* Conversion rate
* Customer satisfaction (ratings and reviews)
* System uptime and response times

## Timeline and Milestones

See Implementation Plan above.

## Open Questions

* Specific choices for message broker configuration.
* Final selection of monitoring and logging tools.
